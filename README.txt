translationstring
=================

A library used by various `Repoze <http://repoze.org>`_ packages for
internationalization (i18n) duties related to translation.

This package provides a *translation string* class, a *translation
string factory* class, translation and pluralization primitives, and a
utility that helps `Chameleon <http://chameleon.repoze.org>`_
templates use translation facilities of this package.  It does not
depend on `Babel <http://babel.edgewall.org>`_, but its translation
and pluralization services are meant to work best when provided with
an instance of the ``babel.support.Translations`` class.

Please see `http://docs.repoze.org/translationstring
<http://docs.repoze.org/translationstring>`_ or the ``docs/index.rst``
file in this package for the documentation.
