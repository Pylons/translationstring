translationstring
=================

0.3 (unreleased)
----------------

- Preserve default translations even if they are an empty string. This
  fixes problems with Chameleon being unable to determine if a translation
  is present or not. Will require Chameleon 1.2.6 or later; previous versions
  pass in a str instead of unicode marker.

0.2 (04-25-2010)
----------------

- Add ``__getstate__`` and ``__reduce__`` methods to translation
  string to allow for pickling.

- Fix bug in ChameleonTranslate.  When ``i18n:translate`` was used in
  templates, a translation string was inappropriately created with a
  ``default`` value of the empty string.  Symptom: template text would
  "disappear" rather than being returned untranslated.

0.1 (04-24-2010)
----------------

- Initial release.
