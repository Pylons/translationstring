translationstring
=================

A library used by various `Repoze <http://repoze.org>`_ packages for
internationalization (i18n) duties.

This package provides a :term:`translation string` class, a
:term:`translation string factory` class, translation and
pluralization primitives, and a utility that helps :term:`Chameleon`
templates use translation facilities of this package.  It does not
depend on :term:`Babel`, but its translation and pluralization
services are meant to work best when provided with an instance of the
:class:`babel.support.Translations` class.
